A description of your game’s theme:

This game is the journey of a guy who started going to the gym. He has to face different enemies: from burgers to alcohol. However, there are also some items that are going to help him achieve his goal and win the game: weights and steroids. It is common knowledge that steroids are not good, but for this guy, it is a boost that will help him become more muscular.
